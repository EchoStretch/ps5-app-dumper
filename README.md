# PS5 App Dumper

**PS5 App Dumper**

A small utility to dump PS5 application files from the console's `pfsmnt` to a connected USB storage device. This project builds into an ELF payload that runs on the PS5 and copies the app files to a mounted USB drive — **it does not support network transfers**.

---

## Important note

This tool **only dumps to USB**. It does **not** stream or transfer dumps over the network. If you need network transfer capabilities you should use a different tool or implement a custom transfer solution.

---

## Requirements

* PS5 Payload SDK by John Tornblom (required). Download and install the SDK and make it available at build time (example: `/opt/ps5-payload-sdk`).

  * Repository: [https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo)

* A PS5 able to run payloads (Jailbroken 1.00 - 10.01).

* A USB drive formatted and mounted on the PS5 (the dumper writes files to the USB).

* **elfldr.elf** — all delivery methods require `elfldr.elf` running on the PS5 to accept and execute incoming payloads. Download: [https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/elfldr/releases/tag/v0.21](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/elfldr/releases/tag/v0.21)

## Building

1. Download and install the required PS5 Payload SDK. Note its path (we'll use `/opt/ps5-payload-sdk` as an example).

2. Point the project at the SDK by exporting the environment variable or editing the `Makefile`:

```bash
export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk
```

3. Build from the repository root:

```bash
make
```

You should get an ELF binary such as `ps5-app-dumper.elf`.

---

## Usage

Both methods require the target PS5 application (the game) to be **already running** and the USB drive to be **plugged into the console** before sending or launching the payload.

### Method 1 — Homebrew launcher + webserv

1. **Copy `ps5-app-dumper` folder** to:

   * `/mnt/usb0/homebrew/`

2. **Included Payload Files:**

   * `ps5-app-dumper.elf`
   * `homebrew.js`

3. Open the Homebrew Launcher with webserv loaded. You will see **PS5 App Dumper** listed. While the app is open, select **PS5 App Dumper** and it will start dumping to USB.

**Downloads:**

* Homebrew launcher: [https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/websrv/releases/tag/v0.24](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/websrv/releases/tag/v0.24)
* webserv: [https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/websrv/releases/tag/v0.26.1](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/websrv/releases/tag/v0.26.1)

3. The payload will run and copy files from `pfsmnt` to the mounted USB drive. Monitor the console output for progress. **Ensure the USB has sufficient free space.**

### Method 2 — Send payload with Netcat GUI (Modded Warfare)

1. On your PC, run the Netcat GUI (Modded Warfare) to prepare to send the payload. (Provided link): [https://www.sendspace.com/file/v765gd](https://www.sendspace.com/file/v765gd)

2. Ensure the target game is already open on the PS5 and the USB drive is plugged into the console.

3. Use the Netcat GUI to send the `ps5-app-dumper.elf` payload to the PS5. The dumper will execute and write the dumped files to the USB drive.

### Method 3 — Send payload with socat

1. Put `ps5-app-dumper.elf` in the folder where you'll run `socat` from.

2. With the app already open on the PS5 and the USB drive plugged in, run the following command on your PC with cmd (replace `<ip>` with the PS5 IP address):

```bash
socat -t 99999999 - TCP:<ip>:9021 < ps5-app-dumper.elf
```

3. The payload will be sent to the PS5. The dumper's log output will appear on the PS5 console screen and in the socat status window.

## Things to Do

* Implement decryption of SELF/ELF files so dumped modules are usable.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. When opening issues or PRs, please include:

* Steps to reproduce the issue.
* Build logs and console output.
* The PS5 firmware version used during testing and any relevant SDK info.

If you intend to work on the ELF/SELF decryption task, please open an issue first so maintainers can coordinate and avoid duplicate work.
